I am not able to get my custom map working using the instructions on D2L. I am encountering the same API key bug that is present in the first two tutorials, but I have not been able to resolve it using the suggested method.
I attempted to insert both raw feature classes (as you can see in my final submission) and I also attempted to insert a pre-created web map as an alternative, but I had no luck getting either to work. Removing the API key and setting all of
the components to public in ArcGIS Online just gives me a login screen regardless of whether I'm signed into AGOL or not. Replacing the API key with the token and running it locally does result in the underlying feature classes
appearing, but no base map appears and the zoom/centre settings I've set seem to have no effect. I have included a screenshot of the latter issue <a href=https://tylerrubini.github.io/geom99lab2/valentinebug.png>here</a>. 
This is occurring in Mozilla Firefox, but I have replicated both issues in Microsoft Edge as well.
